*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by Leandra Lourens*

# Description
This project is a recreation of the standard printf. The primary goal is to learn how to use variatic arguments through handling the various format specifiers, while managing output formatting, flags, precision, and edge cases.

# Instructions
This printf project is meant to be used as a library that makes and uses the libft library. 
## Usage
To use the printf function in your code:
1. Place the printf folder in your project directory.
2. Include this with your other library includes at the top of the file:
```bash
#include "path to printf.h"
```

## Compilation
Compile your C files together with the printf library
```bash
cc *c -L. libftprintf.a -o program_name
```
